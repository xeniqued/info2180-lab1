        <p>Hi there, I'm Xenique, a 3rd Year computer science student from Saint Vincent</p>
        <p> I'm interested in Web Development because offers a unique blend of creativity and technical problem-solving. It allows individuals to bring ideas to life, designing and building websites or applications that people interact with daily. Web development is also a dynamic field, constantly evolving with new technologies and trends, providing endless opportunities for learning and growth.  </p>
